# Storytelling and Tech

## Storytelling

Everyone has a story.

**Characters**

- Real or fictional
- Human or tech

**Setting**

- Where
- Constraints
- Background

**Problem**

- What went wrong

**Complication**

- What makes it worse

**Resolution**

- What happened

**Moral**

- Point of the story
- Larger picture


Our brains crave stories. Oral history was passed down through stories.

Succinct is best.

- Write it out
- Cut our fluff
- Emphasize your tie-ins
- Reinforce with images (any child will tell you stories are better with pictures)

Metaphors translate for you.

> You can use an eraser on the drafting table or a sledge hammer on the construction site.
> ~ Frank Lloyd Wright

When we delete code we are burning money. Code is analogous with buildings and construction.

> You can't be a hero if you started the fire.

**Car Example**

- Ignoring - plow in the back of the car
- Perceiving - see that he's slowing down, swerving around
- Listening - slowing down and identifying why he might be slowing down
